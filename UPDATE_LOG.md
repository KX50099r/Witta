## **Update Log Entry**
**Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Project:** Witta Server  

### **Changes Made**
1. **Elastic IP Configuration:**
   - Elastic IP `52.8.29.234` was set up for the server.
   - Verified server startup and binding to `0.0.0.0`.

2. **Code Updates:**
   - Refactored `orchestrator.py` to include a proper `main` instance of `TaskOrchestratorAsync`.
   - Improved shutdown handling for the orchestrator using a `running` flag.
   - Updated `main.py` with refined lifecycle management (`asynccontextmanager`).

3. **Debugging Steps:**
   - Fixed `uvicorn` command errors by ensuring proper virtual environment activation.
   - Resolved `ImportError` for the `main` object in `orchestrator.py`.
   - Verified server functionality on `127.0.0.1`.

### **Pending Issues**
- The server is responsive locally (`127.0.0.1`) but not accessible via the Elastic IP (`52.8.29.234`).

---

## **To-Do List**
### **Immediate Tasks**
1. **Network Configuration:**
   - Verify AWS Security Group settings for inbound traffic on port `8000`.
   - Confirm Elastic IP is correctly associated with the instance.
   - Check and configure UFW rules on the server if necessary.

2. **Server Access:**
   - Test server accessibility from an external network using the Elastic IP.
   - Ensure `curl` requests to `http://52.8.29.234:8000/` return a valid response.

---

### **Future Tasks**
1. **Code Enhancements:**
   - Add more robust logging for server startup and shutdown.
   - Implement error handling for potential connection issues with Elastic IP.

2. **Front-End Development:**
   - Set up a basic front-end for accessing API endpoints.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Document the current setup for easy replication or scaling.

# Project Progress Log - January 7, 2025

## **Key Achievements**
1. **Refined Architecture**
   - Modularized the project by solidifying the structure for tasks and orchestrator components.
   - Prepared for future integration of agents alongside tasks for improved functionality.

2. **Implemented Server Framework**
   - Set up a FastAPI server running with Uvicorn.
   - Integrated periodic task scheduling functionality and added CORS middleware for API access control.

3. **Debugging and Testing**
   - Fixed multiple issues related to Python imports, module paths, and orchestrator initialization.
   - Established a logging mechanism using `debug.log` to assist with troubleshooting.
   - Successfully ran the `test_app.py`, indicating the core logic is functioning as expected.

4. **Preparation for Next Steps**
   - Highlighted key areas requiring immediate attention, such as improving the server’s periodic task scheduler and stabilizing its runtime behavior.
   - Created a modular framework for task orchestration that can easily incorporate new features in the future.

---

## **Current Status**
- **Server:** Running but shutting down prematurely after startup due to potential issues with the periodic task scheduler or misconfiguration.
- **Tasks:** Orchestrator is functional and can process basic tasks, as confirmed through test scripts.
- **APIs:** Endpoint testing partially successful; improvements required for stability and robustness.

---

## **Tomorrow’s Focus**
1. **Stabilize the Server**
   - Debug and resolve why the server shuts down immediately after startup.
   - Ensure the server remains accessible via `curl` and processes requests correctly.

2. **Enhance Task Orchestration**
   - Implement better error handling and logging in the periodic task scheduler.
   - Verify that the orchestrator integrates seamlessly with the FastAPI server.

3. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Review and update the project directory to improve clarity and organization.
   - Add comments and documentation to code for maintainability.

---

## **The Big Picture**
- Today, we made progress in laying the foundation for a self-managing AI server.
- With a stable server and basic functionality in place, we are positioned to build out advanced features like agent interactions and autonomous decision-making in the near future.
- Focus remains on stability and modularity to support long-term scalability.

## January 5, 2025
### Server Setup
- Finalized AWS server environment.
- Installed and configured Python virtual environment (venv).
- Added necessary dependencies: `openai`, `robin_stocks`, `web3`, `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `python-dotenv`.
- Created `requirements.txt` for dependency tracking.

### Git and SSH Configuration
- Successfully linked server to private GitHub repository using SSH.
- Resolved "Permission denied (publickey)" issue:
  - Added `keychain` to auto-load the SSH key.
  - Configured `~/.bashrc` and `~/.ssh/config` for automatic key management.
- Verified successful push and pull to GitHub repository.

### Initial Tests
- OpenAI API key successfully tested using Replit.
- Robinhood API key and functionality verified with demo script.

---

## Next Steps (Planned for January 6, 2025)
1. **Start Feature Development:**
   - Integrate OpenAI API for basic text generation and governance proposal creation.
   - Begin setting up vector database using Pinecone or alternative.
2. **DeFi and Trading Modules:**
   - SyncSwap API setup for tracking liquidity pool performance.
   - Develop basic trading strategy for Robinhood API.
3. **Governance Prototype:**
   - Create initial governance structure (proposal and voting logic in Python).
   - Test integration of governance with trading and DeFi modules.
