# Project Progress Log - January 7, 2025

## **Key Achievements**
1. **Refined Architecture**
   - Modularized the project by solidifying the structure for tasks and orchestrator components.
   - Prepared for future integration of agents alongside tasks for improved functionality.

2. **Implemented Server Framework**
   - Set up a FastAPI server running with Uvicorn.
   - Integrated periodic task scheduling functionality and added CORS middleware for API access control.

3. **Debugging and Testing**
   - Fixed multiple issues related to Python imports, module paths, and orchestrator initialization.
   - Established a logging mechanism using `debug.log` to assist with troubleshooting.
   - Successfully ran the `test_app.py`, indicating the core logic is functioning as expected.

4. **Preparation for Next Steps**
   - Highlighted key areas requiring immediate attention, such as improving the server’s periodic task scheduler and stabilizing its runtime behavior.
   - Created a modular framework for task orchestration that can easily incorporate new features in the future.

---

## **Current Status**
- **Server:** Running but shutting down prematurely after startup due to potential issues with the periodic task scheduler or misconfiguration.
- **Tasks:** Orchestrator is functional and can process basic tasks, as confirmed through test scripts.
- **APIs:** Endpoint testing partially successful; improvements required for stability and robustness.

---

## **Tomorrow’s Focus**
1. **Stabilize the Server**
   - Debug and resolve why the server shuts down immediately after startup.
   - Ensure the server remains accessible via `curl` and processes requests correctly.

2. **Enhance Task Orchestration**
   - Implement better error handling and logging in the periodic task scheduler.
   - Verify that the orchestrator integrates seamlessly with the FastAPI server.

3. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Review and update the project directory to improve clarity and organization.
   - Add comments and documentation to code for maintainability.

## **The Big Picture**
- Today, we made progress in laying the foundation for a self-managing AI server.
- With a stable server and basic functionality in place, we are positioned to build out advanced features like agent interactions and autonomous decision-making in the near future.
- Focus remains on stability and modularity to support long-term scalability.

## January 5, 2025
### Server Setup
- Finalized AWS server environment.
- Installed and configured Python virtual environment (venv).
- Added necessary dependencies: `openai`, `robin_stocks`, `web3`, `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and `python-dotenv`.
- Created `requirements.txt` for dependency tracking.

### Git and SSH Configuration
- Successfully linked server to private GitHub repository using SSH.
- Resolved "Permission denied (publickey)" issue:
  - Added `keychain` to auto-load the SSH key.
  - Configured `~/.bashrc` and `~/.ssh/config` for automatic key management.
- Verified successful push and pull to GitHub repository.

### Initial Tests
- OpenAI API key successfully tested using Replit.
- Robinhood API key and functionality verified with demo script.

---

## Next Steps (Planned for January 6, 2025)
1. **Start Feature Development:**
   - Integrate OpenAI API for basic text generation and governance proposal creation.
   - Begin setting up vector database using Pinecone or alternative.
2. **DeFi and Trading Modules:**
   - SyncSwap API setup for tracking liquidity pool performance.
   - Develop basic trading strategy for Robinhood API.
3. **Governance Prototype:**
   - Create initial governance structure (proposal and voting logic in Python).
   - Test integration of governance with trading and DeFi modules.
